- TODO:

- goal: behavior recognition framework for sea animals for support of training interactions and behaviors with sea life such as octopi, sea otters and penguins.

- octopi:
    - mood estimation
    - enrichment through interactive activies
        - an improved maze framework I think is going to be the easiest way potentially
        - maybe we can also let them build new habitats for themselves?

- penguins:
    - clear cut goal: get them to swim more and stand around less
    - clear cut initial step: recognize when penguins are swimming
        - tap into livestream via some method
